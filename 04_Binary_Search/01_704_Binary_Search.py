# Time complexity: O(log(N)) - we cut the lists space in half each time. So the worst case is how many times do we need to divide the list by two to end up with 1 element left. 
# 1 = N / 2^X
# 2^X = N
# log2(N) = X
# So we have to divide through log(N) times to get left with 1.
    
#Â Space complexity: O(1) - we don't need to hold any values in memory.
